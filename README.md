# Overview
This repo contains codes and data from Forecasting the 2020 American Federal Election Using Multilevel Regression with Post-stratification. It was created by Siyuan Tao. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the statistical model we built. Some data is unable to be shared in public, we will mention them below. The report contains three parts: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain the original data. We used two datasets:

-Survey data - Tausanovitch, Chris, & Vavreck, L. (2020). Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape, October 10-17, 2019 (version 20200814). Retrieved from https://www.voterstudygroup.org/downloads?key=a359a384-faaa-4117-b988-9357b6db90b0.

-Census data - Ruggles, S., Flood, S., Goeken, R., Grover, J., Meyer, E., Pacas, J., & Sobek, M. (2020). IPUMS USA: Version 10.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS. https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V10.0
  
Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data.

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs to produce outputs. Scripts also contain the R scripts that we built our model.
